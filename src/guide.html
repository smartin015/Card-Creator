                  <ul>
                    <li>Keep yourself healed with Loot, Abilities, or bed rest.
                    <li>Plan with your Party on how to handle the next Encounter.
                    <li>Sort your Ability deck, with your first moves on top.
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h2>Combat</h2>
                  <p>
                    Combat is broken into Rounds. Every round, you'll play an Ability or make up your own action.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Your roll must meet or exceed the risk for the ability to succeed.
                    Every Ability has two numbers on the top right: damage or defense on the top, and risk on the bottom. Abilities with defense (such as wards and certain musics) are played in front of your character and take damage instead of your character. Abilities with damage are directed at enemies to cause them harm.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    When fighting it's important to choose your abilities quickly, and there are no take-backsies and your damage taken increases the longer you deliberate.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Draw three abilities from your ability deck
                      <li>Play an Ability from your hand. Some cards may allow you to play more than one.
                      <li>Discard your hand of remaining abilities into a separate pile from your Ability deck.
                      <li>Roll a D20 and resolve your ability. 
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                        
                  <p>
                  If the result is at least the Risk of the card, you can use the action.
                  Its effects are doubled if a 20 is rolled; if you roll a 1 it critically fails (the negative effects target you; positive effects target the enemy).
                  Be sure to roleplay what your ability did, or else it didn't happen.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    After every combat round, you will likely take damage - and this damage adds up. If your character runs out of Health, they are considered knocked out for several rounds. They may rejoin the combat at the Guide's discretion. If your entire party gets wiped out, the enemy (i.e. the Guide) can do pretty much anything they want with you. KO'd characters usually awaken with 1 Health. If you are knocked out but your party survives the fight, they'll wait for you to regain consciousness and you'll awaken significantly weaker - with only a 1 on the physical health scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It greatly helps to use abilities with Defense to take damage in your stead. If you don't have a defensive ability, ask other party members to take your share of the damage for that round. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Similarly, you aren't limited to what actions you have memorized. Use the situation to your advantage! Your Guide can advise you on the relative risks and merits of improvised actions.  Deviating from what you've practiced does carry a certain amount of extra risk, though.
                  </p>   
                  
                  <p>
                    Arming yourself with training, equipment, and combat knowledge is the best way to stay alive as you travel the realm. We've provided you with the basics, but it's up to you to experience the world and grow stronger within it. Good luck, and try not to die!
